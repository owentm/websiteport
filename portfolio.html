            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Owen Murphy. I am a Computer Science student at 
			Truman State University. I am interested in working on Web Development,
			Software Engineering, and Information Technology! If it's related to Computer Science, 
			I am both interested, and passionate.</p>

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <h3>Tic Tac Toe Bot</h3>
			<p>This is a bot made to play Tic Tac Toe with you! It utilizes an algorithm that 
			makes it almost impossible to beat, and uses packages allowing it to be played 
			in a GUI window. I created it using Java, and the built-in JFrame packages.
			</p> <a href="https://github.com/owentm/tictactoebot"> This is the github link! </a>
			<h3>This website</h3>
			<p>I made this website on my own! It is an online portfolio, 
			that gives more information than a resume can, 
			demonstrates my ability to code in internet based languages, 
			and to be a refrence point for my current projects. I created it using HTML, and CSS.</p> 
			<p><a href="https://github.com/owentm/websiteport"> This is the github link!</a></p>
			<h3>Video Game Comparer</h3>
			<p>This project is currently a work in progress, but when it is completed, it will
			be an application that will allow the user to enter two names of video games that they are
			interested in, and the program will tell the user which game has generally been rated higher 
			on online forums! This application will be created using Python, and the BeautifulSoup packages.</p>

			<h3>Teacher's Assistant, Truman State University</h3>
			<p>Currently, I am working as an assistant to Dr. Sadanala, a Computer Science professor at Truman State University!</p>
			<p>I am in charge of helping students in and outside of class via office hours. 
			In class, I am present for the students labs, in case they need help with any issues,
			whether that be with the software itself, or programming questions.</p>
